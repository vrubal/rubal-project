Sliding window:
  Two pointer algorithm with complexity O(N)
  Patterns:
    1. Constant window size k, where window of size k traverse ahead till end. e.g. maximum sum of k consecutive elements in an array.
    2. Longest substring/subarray e.g pattern matching.
    3. Counting string/subarray matching certain condition. i.e counting subarray with total sum is k.
    4. Minimum window length satisfying certain condition.
