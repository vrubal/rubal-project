Data stored in the colum fashion:

Column id: [1, 2, 3, ...]
Column name: [Alice, Bob, Charlie, ...]
Column age: [25, 30, 22, ...]
Column city: [NYC, LA, SF, ...]


Why use a Columnar database?

Super fast for analytics: If you run a query like SELECT avg(age), a columnar database just reads the age column â€” not the whole table.

Great for compression: Same-type data (like many ages) compresses very well.

Efficient for read-heavy operations: Especially with big data or reporting tools.
