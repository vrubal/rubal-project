Isolation       | Safe for Banking? | Why
READ_COMMITTED  | ‚ùå               | Only prevents dirty reads. No real protection.
REPEATABLE_READ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Better        | Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads. Still can have phantom problems.
SERIALIZABLE    | ‚úÖ Best          | Full isolation. No dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, lost updates, or phantoms.


‚ùó Why READ_COMMITTED is not enough

Problem                             | What Happens at READ_COMMITTED
üî• Lost Update                      | Two users read the same balance and overwrite each other's update.
üî• Non-repeatable Read              | Balance changes between reads inside the same transaction.
üî• No guarantee of real consistency | You can accidentally deduct more than available, or double credit.
